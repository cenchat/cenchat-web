  <section class="legal">
    <h2 class="legal__header">Spam</h2>
    <p class="legal__paragraph">We do not allow spam on Cenchat. All spam will be immediately removed from Cenchat. While it is hard to define this content with precision or completeness, here are some representative behaviors we look for that are characteristic of spam:</p>

    <ul class="legal__list">
      <li>Posting content primarily to drive traffic to, or increase the search rankings of, an external site, product, or service</li>
      <li>Scraping and reposting content from other sources for the primary purpose of generating revenue or other personal gains</li>
      <li>Posting duplicate content, whether from a single account or across multiple accounts</li>
      <li>Stories where the content is clipped with the sole purpose of linking to the rest of the article on a different website.</li>
      <li>Performing a disproportionately large number of interactions, particularly by automated means. This includes bulk, indiscriminate interactions, such as following of other accounts (follow spam)  clapping, or highlighting</li>
      <li>Repeatedly using responses or other interactions as a method of promotion</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="legal__paragraph">For each of these behaviors, when we talk about “content,” we mean not only posts but also any other feature that allows you to add your own text or media. When we talk about “interactions,” we mean any feature that allows one user to interact with another, or with a post.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="legal">
    <h2 class="legal__header">Paid, automatic, bulk, or non-genuine interactions</h2>
    <p class="legal__paragraph">Cenchat depends on various user behaviors — like follows and responses — to determine what content to feature and make the site work well for everyone. So, we don’t allow artificial behaviors that skew this system and as a result degrade or distort other users’ experiences. This includes:</p>

    <ul class="legal__list">
      <li>Buying, selling, or trading in accounts or account interactions — including follows, responses or other traffic</li>
      <li>Using services, apps, or arrangements that offer you more follows, responses, or other interactions on your Cenchat account or content</li>
      <li>Registering accounts, posting content, or interacting with users or content automatically, systematically, or programmatically</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="legal">
    <h2 class="legal__header">Copyright and trademark infringement</h2>
    <p class="legal__paragraph">Respect the copyrights and trademarks of others.

We respond to notices of alleged infringement when you send us an email to support@cenchat.com.</p>

    <h2 class="legal__header">Government Takedown Requests</h2>
    <p class="legal__paragraph">If Cenchat receives a request from a government actor to restrict access to content associated with your account, we will notify you unless we are prohibited by law or believe doing so may endanger others. Where applicable, we will work to limit legally-ordered content restrictions to jurisdictions where we have a good faith belief that we are legally required to restrict the content.</p>
    <p class="legal__paragraph"><em>We may enforce, or not enforce, these policies at our sole discretion. These policies don’t create a duty or contractual obligation for us to act.</em></p>
    <p class="legal__paragraph">We also may change these rules at any time.</p>
